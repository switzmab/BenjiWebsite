      <h4>Blackjack</h4>
      <p>
        I initially created blackjack for a project in a high school which
        tasked us with creating an object-oriented program using many different
        features we learned throughout the course. After finishing the course, I
        have gone through an optimized many components of the program as well as
        attempted to implement JFrame graphic components

      <h4>Kinematics Grapher</h4>
      <p>
        I used a methods assignment focused on doing basic 1 dimensional
        kinematics calculations to build a GUI that would display the
        calculations on a graph once calculated

      <h3><u>C/C++ Projects</u></h3>
      <h4>Snake Game</h4>
      <p>
        Throughout my programming course, I built an object-oriented program in C++ that allowed for a user to play the classic snake game in the terminal. 
        <br>Also used dynamic memory allocation to keep memory leaks within the program to 0.
